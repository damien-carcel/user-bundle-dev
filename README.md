This repository is a Symfony full stack application containing the CarcelUserBundle in its src folder. This application is used only for development purposes.

The bundle itself is available as a read-only [subtree split repository](https://github.com/damien-carcel/UserBundle) and on [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/carcel/user-bundle).

## About the bundle

CarcelUserBundle is a ready to use user management system for Symfony 3 applications, using Doctrine ORM for database storage.

It provides all the elements you need out of the box, yet let you the possibility to customize it at your liking.

This bundle is build upon the [FOSUserBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle).

## Installation

If you didn't, start by [installing composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). You also need to prepare a MySQL database.

Just clone the repository, and install dependencies by running `php composer.phar update`. Composer will ask you for your application configuration (database name, user and password).

Then you can populate this database with a basic set of [doctrine fixtures](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html) provided by the bundle (or create your own, of course):

```bash
    php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
    php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

Your application is ready to run. You can either configure a HTTP server of your choice (Apache, nginxâ€¦) or use the Symfony internal server:

```bash
    php bin/console server:run
```
