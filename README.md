## Installation

### Download and install from GitHub

If you didn't, start by [installing composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/). You also need to prepare a MySQL database.

Just clone the repository, and install dependencies by running `php composer.phar update`. Composer will ask you for your application configuration (database name, user and password).

Then you can populate this database with a basic set of [doctrine fixtures](https://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html) provided by the bundle (or create your own, of course):

```bash
php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

### Deploy the assets

Run the following command:

```bash
bin/console assets:install
bower update
```

### Run the application

The application is now ready to run. You can either configure a HTTP server of your choice (Apache, nginxâ€¦) or use the Symfony internal server:

```bash
php bin/console server:run
```

You should now be able to display the login page (your.application.domain.name/login).
